<h1>README: JW Player</h1>

<p>Thank you for downloading JW Player 6, the world's most popular HTML5/Flash video player! See <a href="http://www.longtailvideo.com/support/jw-player/28832/about-jw-player">About JW Player</a> for an overview of supported browsers/devices, as well as a more detailed feature list. See the <a href="http://www.longtailvideo.com/support/jw-player/28835/release-notes">Release Notes</a> if you want to learn what changed with this latest release.</p>

<h2>Quick Start</h2>

<p>Copy the <strong>jwplayer</strong> folder that contains this README to the www root of your website. Next, include the <em>jwplayer.js</em> script in the &lt;head&gt; of your HTML page.</p>

<p>If you have purchased the <a href="http://www.longtailvideo.com/jw-player/pricing/">Pro, Premium or Ads edition</a> of JW Player, its features can be activated by inserting your server-less JW Player license key in the second line:</p>

<pre>
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="/jwplayer/jwplayer.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;jwplayer.key="ABCDEFGHIJKLMOPQ";&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

<p>Note: A key is not required to use the Free edition, but will still be available from your <a href="https://account.longtailvideo.com/">JW Player Account</a>. Including your key will enable the free <a href="http://www.longtailvideo.com/support/jw-player/28852/using-jw-player-analytics">JW Player Analytics</a> for your account.</p>

<h3>Embed Code</h3>

<p>When the script and key are set, scroll down to the &lt;body&gt; of your HTML page and insert the JW Player embed code at the place you want your video to appear:</p>

<pre>
&lt;div id="myElement"&gt;Loading the player...&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
    jwplayer("myElement").setup({
        file: "/uploads/myVideo.mp4",
        image: "/uploads/myPoster.jpg"
    });
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

<p>See <a href="http://www.longtailvideo.com/support/jw-player/28839/embedding-the-player">Embedding JW Player</a> for a more elaborate description of options and some example embeds.</p>

<h3>Premium Skins</h3>

<p>If you have purchased the Premium or Ads edition of the player, your player includes a set of Premium skins. These skins can be downloaded from your <a href="https://account.longtailvideo.com/">JW Player Account</a>, but you can also load them off our CDN by simply inserting the skin name:</p>
<pre>    skin: "bekle"</pre>
